Cook 4 mins or until translucent and coloured, and add ginger-garlic puree. Fry 2 mins, making sure to scrape the bottom of the pan as it sticks.
- Add tomatoes and fry 5 mins until they soften, then add chilli powder, turmeric powers, and fry a few seconds until they don't smell raw (add a splash of water if needed to prevent burning).
- Add the ground spice powder and fry 30 s, then add rest of water.
- Bring to a boil and simmer 7-10 mins, then add tamarind paste, sugar, and salt to taste.
- Add fish and simmer on low heat until just cooked - 4 mins or so depending on thickness of steaks.
- Add coconut cream and coriander, simmer for a further minute.
- Serve warm with steamed rice and raita.
